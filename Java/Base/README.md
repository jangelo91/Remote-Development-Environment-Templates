# Java Base Template

The Java Base Template is a set of files that allows the user to develop within a fully isolated Java environment. This template utilizes [Visual Studio Code’s](<https://code.visualstudio.com/learn>) Remote – Containers [extension](<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/VSCode>) in addition to [Docker containers](<https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container>).

## Contents

This folder contains configuration files to instruct Docker on how to build the Docker container and VS Code what to include (e.g. VS Code extensions, settings, arguments, etc.). In addition, there is a test file for demonstration.

## Usage

This template is open to anyone, from students who want to learn the Java programming language to development teams looking to streamline their development environment setup. Docker builds the entire environment within minutes, so there is no need to manually install anything. Simply deploy a container for each user and, when necessary, modify the config files and update the containers (advanced). There is no need to manually update each user's environment.

## Requirements

- [Windows 10 Version 2004 or higher](<https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-the-windows-10-october-2020-update-7d20e88c-0568-483a-37bc-c3885390d212>)

- [Install Visual Studio Code](<https://code.visualstudio.com/>)
- [Install Docker Desktop/Engine](<https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop>)
- [Install Visual Studio Code Docker extension](<https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/containers/overview>)
- [Install Visual Studio Code Remote Development Extension](<https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview>)

## QuickStart

1. Clone this repository from GitHub

2. Reopen this folder (your/download/location/path/Remote-Development-Environment-Templates/Java/Base) in VS Code

3. Open the [command pallette](<https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#:~:text=The%20most%20important%20key%20combination,provides%20access%20to%20many%20commands.>) (press F1 or Ctrl+Shift+P)

4. Enter "Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container"

5. Select this folder. Docker should start building the container, and there will be a progress bar to the bottom right of the window

6. Open Test.java and run the code (press F5, hit "run" right above the "main" method, or navigate to Run > Start Debugging)
